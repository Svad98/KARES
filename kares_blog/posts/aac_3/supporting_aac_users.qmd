What can we do to help our AAC users with whatever system they are using? Let’s start by reviewing some of the best practices from experts _and_ AAC users themselves.

### Ensure that the AAC system is accessible. 
Taking a child’s AAC system away is like covering a speaking child’s mouth. 

**Note:** in cases where it may not be feasible to always have the system in hand, you can try to have the AAC system within reach if your child motions that they need it using other forms of multimodal communication.

### Provide Aided language stimulation/input/modeling
This is a strategy to teach children symbol meanings. Model this to your child without expecting them to imitate or respond in a certain way.


### Move beyond requesting
There’s a lot more that we do when we communicate. We should model this

### Support motor planning
Your child has to learn the “motor plan” for every button on their AAC system. Over multiple repetitions, they can store these messages in their memory.

Ensure there are as many buttons as possible on the page. This allows your child to learn everything without having to learn a new motor plan. 

Include example to video stamp/pictures to click. Use a consistent grid size and progress on how many messages you can show on the grid. Mask during specific teaching opportunities and then open the entire AAC system back

### Teaching Core (& fringe) vocabulary

### Allow for single word combinations and whole word phrases
How people process language (analytic language) or gestalt language processes

### Least-to-most prompt hierarchy
Allow the child to build independence as they use their AAC system.

### Attribute Meaning 
Even if you think what the child is saying is random or a mistake, always attribute meaning to what the child is saying.


###	Wait 
AAC users require wait time. Can be 10 times slower than spoken language. 135 words/minute in speech vs 10 words/minute

### Don’t’ require the child to express the same message more than once
Doing this can communicate that their first attempt wasn’t good enough.
