    "text": "How to Support AAC users\n\n1. Ensure that the AAC system is accessible.\nTaking a child’s AAC system away is like covering a speaking child’s mouth.\nNote: in cases where it may not be feasible to always have the system in hand, you can try to have the AAC system within reach if your child motions that they need it using other forms of multimodal communication.\n\n\n2. Provide Aided language stimulation/input/modeling\nThis is a strategy to teach children symbol meanings. Model this to your child without expecting them to imitate or respond in a certain way.\n\n\n3. Move beyond requesting\nThere’s a lot more that we do when we communicate. We should model this\n\n\n4. Support motor planning\nYour child has to learn the “motor plan” for every button on their AAC system. Over multiple repetitions, they can store these messages in their memory.\nEnsure there are as many buttons as possible on the page. This allows your child to learn everything without having to learn a new motor plan.\nUse a consistent grid size and slowly increase how many messages you can show on the grid. Mask during specific teaching opportunities and then open the entire AAC system back.\n\n\n5. Teaching Core (& fringe) vocabulary\n\n\n6. Allow for single word combinations and whole word phrases\nHow people process language (analytic language) or gestalt language processes\n\n\n7. Least-to-most prompt hierarchy\nAllow the child to build independence as they use their AAC system.\n\n“Inspire, don’t require” – Rachel Madel, Speech-Language Pathologist and Owner of AAC Ally.\n\nKate McLaughlin’s AAC Prompt Hierarchy\n\n\n8. Attribute Meaning\nEven if you think what the child is saying is random or a mistake, always attribute meaning to what the child is saying.\n\n\n9. Wait\nAAC users require wait time. Can be 10 times slower than spoken language. 135 words/minute in speech vs 10 words/minute\n\n\n10. Don’t’ require the child to express the same message more than once\nDoing this can communicate that their first attempt wasn’t good enough."

    "section": "",
    "text": "To be more mindful and inclusive in our communication, let’s consider the following:\n\nScenario 1:\nImbalance: The speaking person tends to dominate the conversation by determining the topic and asking A LOT of questions. Here, the AAC user has to talk about what the speaking person wants to talk about\nLevel: We wait for the AAC user to initiate conversation or invite them to start the conversation. The goal is to use fewer questions and, instead, use more “I wonder” statements like “I wonder what you’d like to talk about.”\n\n\nScenario 2:\nImbalance: The speaking person often determines which mode of communication is “best” and forces the AAC user to use that mode. The AAC user may prefer to use a different mode of communication than the one being offered due to emotional or sensory dysregulation.\nLevel: Remember that AAC users are carrying multiple loads (sensory or motor) which can be impacted to different degrees throughout the day/depending on the context. We can level the scale by allowing the child to communicate with the mode they are most comfortable with at that time.\n\nNote: if you cannot understand what your child is saying, it may be helpful to ask them if they could clarify with their talker or gestures etc.\n\n\n\nScenario 3:\nImbalance: When the speaking person does not offer enough wait time before jumping in and prompting the AAC user on what to say. The AAC User may feel that if they were just given a little more time, they could have formulated a message on their own. Without this wait time, over multiple occurrences, the AAC user learns to wait to be prompted.\nLevel: Get comfortable sitting in the silence\n\n\nScenario 4:\nImbalance: When the speaking person doesn’t confirm the meaning of the message or makes assumptions about the meaning of the message. This can lead to misinterpretation of the message that the AAC user is trying to convey.\nLevel: We can help a child clarify or co-construct a message with them. Again, using “I wonder” statements for instance, “I wonder if you want to do ____.”\n\n\nScenario 5:\nImbalance: The speaking person focuses on technology and strategies above building an authentic relationship with their child by sharing in their interests while the AAC user just wants to be a kid and have fun.\nLevel: Focus on building rapport and taking interest in the uniqueness of the AAC user.\nThese different scenarios only scratch the surface of how we can create a supportive environment for AAC users. Let’s equip ourselves with some more insights on how to support AAC users"

Can you relate to any of these?\n\nMood Exhaustion, confusion, feeling like “in a fog”, irritability, anxiety, anger, agitation, sadness, numbness, guilt, grief, dissociation, tearfulness, overwhelm, detached, helplessness\nBehaviors Hyper-vigilance, blunted affect, snaps or angers quickly, zones out or checks out, overly attempting to fix or control, forgetting things, use unhealthy ways to “cope”, distancing, smothering, avoidance of triggers, social withdrawal\nPhysical Sleeplessness or insomnia, mysterious aches and pains, frequently sick, stomach issues, headaches, intense startle, tightness in chest (panic), flashbacks, sudden weight loss or gain\n\nBe sure to check in with each other and yourself so that you can take care of yourselves before caring for everyone else\n\nBefore I could release\nThe weight of my sadness\nAnd pain, I first had to\nhonor its existence\n— Yung Pueblo\n\nSo what do we do when we see these trauma responses in ourselves?"

The unaided modes of communication are more accessible to AAC users since they can use their bodies to communicate when other tools/objects are not easily available.\nNow that we know what AAC is, let’s learn more about how to shift our mindset on the use of AAC.To do this, one question we can ask ourselves is: Why should we advocate for multimodal communication?"

Learn more about the differences between these two responses to demands, in this article.\nThere are many reasons why your child may avoid completing a task you ask them to do. This avoidance is often due to difficulty with:\n\nSensory experience\nInitiating tasks\nSwitching from one task to the next\nAnxiety about not doing well\nShame\nTolerating uncertainty\nLack of control/choice\nEmotional regulation\nFlexibility\nSustaining attention\nUnderstanding expectations\n\n\nDemands are everywhere\n\nDirect demands e.g., from parents “Pick up your shoes”, “Go to school” etc.\nIndirect demands e.g., internal demands like feeling hungry, sleepy, having to go to the bathroom etc\nInternalized and Externalized Expressions of PDA\n\nExternalized: more obvious behavior challenges like pushing back\nInternalized: may mask some of their challenges. May agree to a task while thinking of ways to avoid completing that demand"

For example, if your child had to spend the whole day in school, experienced a loud assembly and had too many tasks to complete by the end of the day, they may not have the capacity to tolerate the frustrating task of homework after school.\nGap between expectation and reality/prediction error. For example, say your child is used to getting home and receiving a particular snack from you. If that day you are all out of that snack, they may have a difficult time understanding why they cannot get that snack and self-regulating to accommodate that unexpected change in routine.\nNavigating a world designed for neurotypical people. For example, in a world where there is an over-reliance on speech, your child may experience a dysregulation of senses if they are non-speaking or minimally-speaking and their conversation partner is not doing their part to accommodate that need.\nParental/Adult expectations do not match the child’s abilities. There was a study showing that half of parents believed their children have more ability to manage their impulses and control their emotions than they actually do."

For instance, how you respond to your child’s meltdown when you refuse them from using their iPad may be entirely different to your response if they experience a seizure. While even the underlying neurobiology is different in some sense, it is important to consider that both of these events are depictions of your child’s loss of control.\nThis is where PDA really manifests as an unseen disability and can foster the false judgement that parents of children having a meltdown are undisciplined."

Viewing your child as someone who can’t switch from one task to another or regulate their emotions in a particular way instead of someone who won’t do what you want them to do\nWhat vs Why. Switch from asking what is the behavior we’re seeing to why is this particular behavior happening. For instance, if you get a report from school about your child throwing a pencil or pinching a playmate, challenge yourself to ask why your child reacted in this way. Understanding why this was your child’s behavior creates a space for proactively learning how to prevent this/meet your child’s need going forward.\nControl vs Comfort.\nExternal behavior vs internal experience. Your child may be expressing an internal experience through external behavior such as a meltdown. When this happens, it is important to shift your focus from the external behavior to try to understand what internal experience may be influencing this situation.\nInflexible vs Flexible. Adults should be more flexible when handling big behavior challenges that arise.\nIndependence vs Interdependence. There can be an over-focus on independence. It is important, however, to keep in mind that we all depend on each other in some way and that we should be mindful of the expectation vs ability mismatch that may exist (discussed above)\nChanging the child vs Changing the system around the child. If you see a problem, instead of focusing on what to change in your child, look at their environment and creatively address the stressors/make accommodations that would decrease the load on your child."

As a parent it is important to reflect on your own parenting history, assess how your child is similar or different from you, and take time to process your fears.\nParent and child understand hidden stressors and recognize when stress is increasing.\nAs a parent, reflect on how you can make the hidden disability/stressors more visible so you can mitigate them before they become overwhelming.\nInstead of considering yourself as the authority over your child, take on a “Relationship First” mentality where you exercise your flexibility and challenge your views on parental control of kids. This is not the same as saying that you should let your child do whatever they want. It is, however, taking a different approach to parenting that gives your child more independence while maintaining their safety.\nStriving toward the “just right” challenge by slowly increasing demands after period of increased regulation.\nCome to a place of radical acceptance for the things we can’t change. This is a messy and ever-changing process of parenting. You can both help your child and accept the way things are."

It is also a simple technique to learn as we will break down below:\n\nFirst, picture a box and Inhale gradually as you fill your lungs with air and visualize yourself going across the top of the box (for example left to right).\nWhen you get to the other end, Hold your breath for 1-5 seconds as you picture yourself going down the box.\nExhale gradually as you imagine traveling backwards (for example right to left) and\nHold one more time for about 5 seconds as you go to the top of the box and start the breathing pattern over.\n\nFor ease, follow the box below to you practice this breathing technique\n\n\n\n\n\nThis technique can be done multiple times and in different ways.\n\n\n2. The Cognitive Triangle\nThis triangle demonstrates how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors affect one another. Understanding how these three factors connect can equip you to take control of any situation even when, at first, it may not feel like it is possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing we can especially pay attention to is how we think. Let’s discuss some thinking errors here; you may be even able to point out some that you’ve found yourself practicing:\n\nAll-or-Nothing Thinking: Where a person thinks in terms of extremes. For example, a parent may believe that their child’s disability is all bad and that there are no positive aspects to it.\nOvergeneralization: When a person takes one negative event and uses it to predict future outcomes. E.g: A Parent may assume that their child will never be able to learn a new skill because they had difficulty with it in the past.\nMental Filtering: This is when a person focuses only on the negative aspects of a situation and ignores the positive. E.g a parent may only focus on the limitations of their child’s disability and overlook their strengths and abilities.\nPersonalization: When a person takes responsibility for things that are outside of their control. E.g a parent blames themselves for their child’s diagnosis even though it is not their fault.\nCatastrophizing: When a person assumes the worst-case scenario will happen. E.g a parent may assume that their child will never be able to live independently or have a fulfilling life because of their disability.\nEmotional Reasoning: When a person assumes that their emotions are evidence of the truth. E.g, a parent may feel overwhelmed and assume that they are not capable of providing the best care for their child, even though they are doing their best.\nLabeling: When a person uses negative labels to describe themselves or others. E.g, a parent may label their child as “not capable” which can have a negative impact on their self-esteem.\n\n\n\nWhy spend so much time reflecting on your thoughts?\n\nSometimes our thoughts and feelings can prevent us from reaching out and getting the support we need\nFrom our thoughts, come our actions. We may know what we ought to do but we have to pay attention to our thoughts so we can identify what keeps us from doing something that will benefit us/behavior that will build our social system"
